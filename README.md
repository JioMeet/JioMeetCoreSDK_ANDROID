## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

#### Hilt:

To set up Hilt in your Android project, follow these steps:

1. First, add the hilt-android-gradle-plugin plugin to your projectâ€™s root build.gradle file:

   ```gradle
   plugins {
   id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android") version "2.44" apply false
   }
   ```

2. Add the Hilt dependencies to the app-level build.gradle file

   ````gradle
   plugins {
     kotlin("kapt")
     id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android")
   }

   android {
       ...
       compileOptions {
           sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
           targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       }
   }

   dependencies {
           implementation "androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose:1.0.0"
           implementation "com.google.dagger:hilt-android:2.44"
           kapt "com.google.dagger:hilt-android-compiler:2.44"
   } ```
   ````

before you proceed.

###### Get you Jiomeet meeting id and pin

Use
the [create meeting api](https://dev.jiomeet.com/docs/JioMeet%20Platform%20Server%20APIs/create-a-dynamic-meeting)
to get your room id and password

---

## Configure JioMeet Core SDK inside your app

i. In Gradle Scripts/build.gradle (Module: <projectname>) add the CORE dependency. The dependencies
section should look like the following:

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "com.jiomeet.platform:jiomeetcoresdk:<version>"
    ...
}
```

Find the [Latest version](https://github.com/JioMeet/JioMeetCoreSDK_ANDROID/releases) of the Core
SDK and replace <version> with the one you want to use. For example: 2.1.8.

### Add permissions for network and device access.

In /app/Manifests/AndroidManifest.xml, add the following permissions after </application>:

```gradle
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

<!-- The SDK requires Bluetooth permissions in case users are using Bluetooth devices. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<!-- For Android 12 and above devices, the following permission is also required. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

### Requesting run time permissions

it's crucial to request some permissions like **_CAMERA ,RECORD_AUDIO, READ_PHONE_STATE_** at
runtime since these are critical device access permissins to ensure a seamless and secure user
experience. Follow these steps

1. Check Permissions

```kotlin
if (checkPermissions()) {
  // Proceed with using the features.
} else {
  // Request critical permissions at runtime.
}
```

2. Request Runtime Permissions:

```kotlin
private void requestCriticalPermissions() {
  ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(
    this,
    new String []{
      Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE,
      Manifest.permission.CAMERA,
      Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO
    },
    PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE
  );

}
```

3. Handle Permission Results

```kotlin
@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult(
  int requestCode,
  @NonNull String[] permissions,
  @NonNull int[] grantResults
) {
  if (requestCode == PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE) {
    if (areAllPermissionsGranted(grantResults)) {
      // Proceed with using the features that require critical permissions.
    } else {
      // Handle denied permissions, especially for camera and phone state, which are essential.
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Initialisation

we will be initialise the JMClient

```kotlin
// Import the necessary classes and packages

// 1. Create an instance of JMClientViewModel by injecting it with JMClient as a dependency.

// Example of injecting JMClientViewModel using Hilt:
@HiltViewModel
class JMClientViewModel @Inject constructor(private val jmClient: JMClient) : ViewModel() {
  init {
    jmClient.init()
    // Perform other setup operations here if needed
  }
}

class YourActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
  private val jmClientViewModel: JMClientViewModel by viewModels()

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_your)

    // JMClientViewModel is created and initialized upon first access.
    // The JMClient initialization and other setup operations will be executed in the ViewModel's constructor.
  }
}


```

  **Usage**
  Call this method after successfully joining a meeting to control audio stream subscription for
  remote users.

  ```kotlin
  // Example: Subscribe to a remote user's video stream
  jmClient.subscribeRemoteUserAudio(123, true)

  // Example: Unsubscribe from a remote user's video stream
  jmClient.subscribeRemoteUserAudio(456, false)

* ### Virtual background
  `applyVirtualBackground` is a method that allows you to apply a virtual background to the video
  stream.Once the virtual background feature is enabled, all users in the channel can see the custom
  background.
  ```kotlin
  public final fun applyVirtualBackground(virtualBackgroundType: VirtualBackgroundType): Unit
  ```
  **Parameters**
  - `virtualBackgroundType` (Type: `VirtualBackgroundType`): The type of virtual background to
    apply.

    **`VirtualBackgroundType`**
    VirtualBackgroundType is an enumeration representing different types of virtual backgrounds
    that can be applied to a video stream.

    **Enum Values**

    - `NONE`: Represents no virtual background.
    - `BLUR`: Represents a blurred virtual background.
    - `IMAGE`: Represents a virtual background using an image.

    **Properties**

    - `imagePath` (Type: `String?`): A property associated with each enum value. It stores the
      path or URL of a custom image used as a virtual background when the `IMAGE` type is
      selected.
      **Usage**
      You can use the `VirtualBackgroundType` enumeration to specify the type of virtual
      background to apply when using the `applyVirtualBackground` method in your application.
  ```kotlin
  // Example: Apply a blurred virtual background
  jmClient.applyVirtualBackground(VirtualBackgroundType.BLUR)

  // Example: Remove virtual background
  jmClient.applyVirtualBackground(VirtualBackgroundType.NONE)

  // Example: Apply a virtual background with a specific image path
    val type = VirtualBackgroundType.IMAGE
    type.imagePath = "https://example.com/custom-background.jpg"
    jmClient.applyVirtualBackground(VirtualBackgroundType.IMAGE)
  ```

  again when you need to load more chat messages, such as when the user scrolls through the chat
  thread.
  ```kotlin
    // Example: Fetch the next chat message
  if (!state.isLoading && !state.endReached && state.items.isNotEmpty()) {
      jmClient.fetchNextChatMessage()
  }
  //where state = jmClient.state
  ```
  ##### **`sendChatMessage`**
  A suspend method that allows users to send a chat message in the meeting. It sends the specified
